# Git No-Pager for Diff Command

## Context

- Git diff command produces output that automatically uses a pager (less, more) by default.
- Paged output can be problematic in automated environments or when commands are performed by agents.
- The `--no-pager` flag prevents git from using a pager for command output.
- This rule ensures proper handling of git diff command output without interactive paging.
- Critical for AI assistants to ensure proper display of git diff results.
- Also applies to other git commands that produce substantial output (log, show, etc.).

## Critical rules

- Always use `git --no-pager diff` or append `| cat` when using the git diff command.
- The `--no-pager` flag must be placed right after `git` and before the `diff` subcommand.
- For git aliases or scripts that use diff, prefer using `git --no-pager diff` over piping to `cat`.
- For programmatic access to git diff output, always use `--no-pager` to ensure reliable parsing.
- When displaying git diff output in terminal sessions, use `--no-pager` to prevent interactive pager prompts.
- Apply the same pattern to other git commands that trigger pager behavior:
  - `git --no-pager log`.
  - `git --no-pager show`.
  - `git --no-pager branch -a`.
- Never place `--no-pager` after the git subcommand as it won't be recognized correctly.
- For git config, consider setting `git config --global core.pager cat` as a permanent solution.

## Examples

<example type="valid">
# Viewing diff without pager
git --no-pager diff

# Viewing diff between branches without pager

git --no-pager diff main..feature-branch

# Viewing staged changes without pager

git --no-pager diff --staged

# Alternative approach using pipe to cat

git diff | cat

# Diff with specific file without pager

git --no-pager diff filename.txt

# View commit history without pager

git --no-pager log --oneline -n 10
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Incorrect: Wrong placement of --no-pager flag
git diff --no-pager

# Incorrect: Using pager and then trying to pipe

git diff | cat

# Incorrect: This will trigger a pager

git diff

# Incorrect: Flag in wrong position

git diff --staged --no-pager
</example>
